Store, compress, and retrieve long-term memories with semantic lossless compression. One unified Python package; auto-routing between text and multimodal (image / audio / video) backends.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from simplemem import SimpleMem

mem = SimpleMem()  # auto mode — backend chosen by first call

mem.add_dialogue(
    "Alice",
    "Bob, let's meet at Starbucks tomorrow at 2pm",
    "2025-11-15T14:30:00",
)
mem.add_dialogue(
    "Bob",
    "Sure, I'll bring the market analysis report",
    "2025-11-15T14:31:00",
)
mem.finalize()

answer = mem.ask("When and where will Alice and Bob meet?")
# → "16 November 2025 at 2:00 PM at Starbucks"
```

The first method you call selects the backend:

| First call | Backend |
|:--|:--|
| `add_dialogue()` | Text (SimpleMem) |
| `add_text()` / `add_image()` / `add_audio()` / `add_video()` | Multimodal (Omni-SimpleMem) |

For explicit control:

```python
from simplemem import create
mem = create(mode="text")   # or mode="omni"
```

### Tune retrieval (quick API)

Tune retrieval hyperparameters offline on your own dev set, then deploy the
resulting `Config` for inference:

```python
import simplemem
from simplemem import SimpleMem, load_config

dev_questions = [
    ("When is the meeting?", "2pm tomorrow"),
    ("What should Bob prepare?", "quarterly report and client feedback"),
]
config = simplemem.optimize(mem, dev_questions, max_rounds=3)
config.save("my_config.json")

# Later, deploy with optimized config
config = load_config("my_config.json")
mem = SimpleMem(config=config)
```

This is a thin convenience wrapper. It searches retrieval parameters on your
`dev_questions` and writes back a deployable `Config`. It does **not**
reproduce the paper numbers, because the paper experiments rely on
benchmark-specific category labels, adapter prompts, and seeded session
ordering that this API does not surface. To reproduce the paper, see the
**Reproducing paper results** section below.

### Reproducing paper results

The original EvolveMem entry point is preserved under `EvolveMem/` as a
self-contained, paper-faithful standalone version. It implements the full
self-evolution loop described in the paper (Evaluate, Diagnose, Propose,
Guard) with per-category overrides and benchmark adapters for LoCoMo,
MemBench, and LongMemEval. This is the canonical way to reproduce the
published numbers.

```bash
cd EvolveMem
pip install -r requirements.txt

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://api.openai.com/v1"
export LLM_MODEL="gpt-4o"

python run_evolution.py --data data/locomo10.json --max-rounds 7
```

See `EvolveMem/README.md` for the full guide, including MemBench and
LongMemEval entry points and per-benchmark configuration.

## 📦 Installation

Requirements: **Python 3.10+** and an OpenAI-compatible API key.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aiming-lab/SimpleMem.git
cd SimpleMem

pip install -e .                  # default: text + multimodal + evolver
pip install -e ".[server]"        # + MCP / HTTP server (mcp, fastapi, ...)
pip install -e ".[all]"           # everything, including dev tools

cp config.py.example config.py
# Edit config.py with your API key and (optional) base URL.
```

## 📋 TODO (refactor handoff)

Outstanding items from the `simplemem/` package merge. Drop these as fast as work lands; they're not visible to users of the text path but matter for finishing the unified package.

### 🟠 Partial — `simplemem.optimize()` wrapper still has API gaps

All `simplemem.*` imports work now (config modules landed in `d59fa45`). But the `simplemem.optimize()` wrapper in `simplemem/evolver/optimize.py` still has two API mismatches against the actual `EvolutionEngine`: it omits the required `llm_call` argument when constructing the engine, and it calls a non-existent `engine.run()` (the real method is `engine.evolve(sessions, qa_pairs)`).

- [ ] Rewrite `simplemem/evolver/optimize.py` to construct `EvolutionEngine(llm_call, embedder, config)` and call `.evolve(sessions, qa_pairs)`.
- [ ] Decide the contract for `simplemem.optimize()`. Either degraded-tuner mode (no category labels, no adapter, simplified `(question, gt)` tuples), or full passthrough that takes `sessions` + `qa_pairs` + `adapter` directly.

To reproduce paper numbers without waiting on this wrapper, use `EvolveMem/run_evolution.py` directly. See **Reproducing paper results** above.

### 🟡 Non-blocking — legacy top-level dirs left in place

The pre-refactor sources (`models/`, `utils/`, `database/`, `core/`, `OmniSimpleMem/`) still sit at the repo root and are imported by `main.py`, `test_locomo10.py`, `tests/`, `cross/`, `SKILL/`, `MCP/`, and `simplemem/integrations/*`. They were intentionally **not** deleted in this pass to avoid breaking those entry points. To finish cleaning up:

- [ ] Rewrite each of the above to import from `simplemem.core.*` / `simplemem.multimodal` instead of the top-level paths.
- [ ] Delete the legacy top-level dirs once nothing depends on them.

Note: `EvolveMem/` is **intentionally kept** at the repo root as the self-contained, paper-faithful standalone version. See **Reproducing paper results** above. It is not on the cleanup list.

### 🟢 Done in this refactor pass (for context)

- `simplemem/` unified package: router (`SimpleMem` / `create` / `list_modes`), `optimize`, `Config`, `load_config` — all importable.
- Text path validated end-to-end against `examples/quickstart.py` (Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B + LanceDB + Tantivy FTS).
- `simplemem/core/settings.py` reads user's `config.py` first, then env vars, then built-in defaults.
- `simplemem/multimodal/` imports rewritten from `omni_memory.*` to `simplemem.multimodal.*` (38 files).
- `simplemem/evolver/optimize.py` import path corrected (`simplemem.optimizer` → `simplemem.evolver`) and the stale `from evolvemem.multi_retriever import …` in `evolution.py` was retargeted to `simplemem.evolver.multi_retriever`.
- `setup.py` with `install_requires` grounded in `MCP/requirements.txt`, `OmniSimpleMem/setup.py`, and commit `9686aa5`'s canonical `pyproject.toml`. `pip install --dry-run -e .` and `-e ".[server]"` both resolve cleanly.
- `simplemem/config.py`, `simplemem/evolver/config.py`, `simplemem/multimodal/core/config.py` added in `d59fa45` (root-cause was an over-broad `.gitignore` rule; fixed there too). All `simplemem.*` subpackages now import cleanly.
- `EvolveMem/evolvemem/config.py` added (paper-faithful defaults from `99cd447`). The standalone `python EvolveMem/run_evolution.py` entry point now imports and bootstraps without errors.
